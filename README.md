# Nintendle

<p>Nintendle is a <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html' target='_blank'>Wordle</a> clone with an emphasis on Nintendo-themed solutions. Like Wordle, Nintendle features a new challenge each day (one for every day of the year) and includes a share button to easily share your score.</p>

<p>The dictionary of solutions was curated by hand and includes a variety of Nintendo characters, themes, locations, and concepts. Some of the references are pretty minor! <a href='https://www.ssbwiki.com/List_of_spirits_(complete_list)' target='_blank'>This list of Nintendo references from Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a> was used as a source of truth when building the dictionary, and may be of help when working out some of the solutions, though not every Nintendle came from this list!</p>
